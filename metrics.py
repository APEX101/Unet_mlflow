ONE PROBLEM WITH PYFUNC IS IT ONLY ACCEPTS 2d INPUTS
INCASE OF MULTIDIM YOU CAN USE DIFFERENT FLAVORS EG TF BUT
THEN YOU CANNOT ADD THE PIPELINE ONLY MODEL INPUTS AND OUTPUTS CAN 
BE EVAL W/O ANY POSTPROCESS
WAYAROUND: save the preporcess data seperately then use the model passing
afterwards, in metrics post process the data and transform it before evaluating
or 
only use model in and out eval
